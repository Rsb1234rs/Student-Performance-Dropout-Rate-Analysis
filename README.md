##  Student-Performance-Dropout-Rate-Analysis
This project aims to identify key factors influencing student performance and dropout rates in educational institutions. By analyzing students' academic backgrounds, it seeks to uncover patterns and trends that impact retention and success rates.

**Key Analysis Areas**  
Student Performance Trends: 
   - Identify trends in GPA over semesters.  
   - Compare performance across Students,subjects & departments.
   - Identified Average, Topper and lower score of Batch, Branch and Subject wise  
   - Detect students at risk of failing or dropping out.  
Dropout Rate Analysis:
   - Identify patterns in dropout trends by semester and Year.  
   - Analyze attendance vs. dropout correlation.  
   - Predict at-risk students using Regression Analysis.  
Attendance & Performance Relationship:  
   - Analyze how attendance percentage affects grades.  
  Department Wise Performance:
    - Identify hardest subjects based on failure rates.

## **Steps to Execute the Project**  

1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Collection & Cleaning (SQL,Excel,Power BI) 
- Import student performance data into SQL database.  
- Clean missing values, standardize grades, and remove duplicates.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Analysis (SQL Queries, Power BI ) 
- Query GPA trends, dropout rates, and attendance patterns.  
- Use SQL joins to merge student, subject, and attendance tables.  
- Perform aggregations (AVG, COUNT, SUM) to extract insights.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Visualization (Power BI / Google Data Studio)  
dashboards  
  ‚úÖ Student performance trends
  ‚úÖ Dropout rates by semester  
  ‚úÖ Attendance vs. grades correlation

## **üîπ Expected Insights & Outcomes:**  
‚úÖ Identify **at-risk students** before they drop out.  
‚úÖ Detect **key subjects** where students struggle the most.  
‚úÖ Analyze how **attendance impacts student performance**.  
‚úÖ Provide **data-driven suggestions** to improve retention.
